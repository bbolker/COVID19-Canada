## COVID19 Testing Data

Our [_raw_ dataset](https://github.com/wzmli/COVID19-Canada/raw/master/COVID-19_test.csv) is compiled from available, open sources on the web â€“ primarily provincial-level public health websites, see file for URLs 

We update once per day around 22:00 Toronto time.

This dataset contains daily reported number of positive/negative confirmed cases, presumptive cases, under investigation, and sources. 

Data before March 14, 2020 were recovered using the [Way Back Machine](https://archive.org/web/); later data are gathered daily directly from the sites. 

## Curating Data

Our [*curated* data set](https://github.com/wzmli/COVID19-Canada/raw/master/clean.Rout.csv):

* puts all of the information into a consistent format
* calculates daily incidence from cumulative cases
* corrects minor errors (using [this script](clean.R))

When possible we use summary reports from [the federal outbreak website](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html) to check our error correction
