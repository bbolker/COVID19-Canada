The hospitalization columns (including ICU and ventilators) have different meanings from province to province. We are working on documenting this.

Most of provinces report prevalence (current numbers) of hospitalization and ICU.
AB and BC are the only two provinces reporting cumulative (ever) hospitalization and ICU cases (BC changed to ICU prevalence after April 2nd)

ON hospitalization, ICU and ventilators counts before April 2nd are recovered from daily live covid19 updates by Ontario's Chef Medical Officers of Health (See Notes column in the data for link).
