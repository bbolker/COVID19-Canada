# To do

- Double check how different are the testing criteria across all Canadian provinces.

- Is the time stamp in README.md automated? (Could use README.rmd for this ...) Do we need separate front ends/READMEs for the GH pages version ("end-user") and the repo version ("developer")?  (I had to guess to `make plot.png` to generate `plot.wrapR.r`. Or do we not think that anyone else will want to mess with the repo-level machinery?)

- consider colorspace + `scale_colour_discrete_qualitative()` ?
